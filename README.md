🌟 FairShare — Equitable Living Simplified

Human-centered fintech for shared living
Reducing roommate money conflicts through fairness intelligence and socially-aware expense management.

📌 Overview

FairShare is a smart expense sharing system designed for hostels and shared accommodations. Unlike traditional expense trackers that focus only on numbers, FairShare focuses on people — addressing the emotional and social friction that arises from shared financial responsibilities.

We combine financial logic + behavioral design to transform awkward money conversations into smooth, conflict-free interactions.

🚩 Problem Statement

Awkward reminders about unpaid dues

Uneven financial contributions
