# 🌟 FairShare — Equitable Living Simplified
### Human-centered fintech for shared living

Reducing roommate money conflicts through fairness intelligence and socially-aware expense management.

---

## 📌 Overview
FairShare is a smart expense sharing system designed for hostels and shared accommodations.

Unlike traditional expense trackers that focus only on numbers, FairShare focuses on people — addressing the emotional and social friction that arises from shared financial responsibilities.
We combine financial logic + behavioral design to transform awkward money conversations into smooth, conflict-free interactions.
