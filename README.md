# 🌟 FairShare — Equitable Living Simplified
### Human-centered fintech for shared living

Reducing roommate money conflicts through fairness intelligence and socially-aware expense management.

---

## 📌 Overview
FairShare is a smart expense sharing system designed for hostels and shared accommodations.

Unlike traditional expense trackers that focus only on numbers, FairShare focuses on people — addressing the emotional and social friction that arises from shared financial responsibilities.
We combine financial logic + behavioral design to transform awkward money conversations into smooth, conflict-free interactions.

### ⚙️ Fairness Logic (Core Algorithm)

FairShare ensures balanced contributions using proportional expense tracking.

**Contribution Score Formula**

```text
contribution_score_i = (Total Paid by User_i) / (Total Room Expenses)
```

The system prioritizes the user with the lowest contribution score as the suggested next payer.

### Conflict Detection

```text
imbalance_i = Total Paid_i - (Total Room Expenses / N)
```

If the imbalance exceeds a defined threshold, the Conflict Monitor triggers a fairness alert.

## 🏷 Personality Tagging System

FairShare categorizes payment behavior patterns to improve social communication.

| Tag |	Criteria |
| :--- | :--- |
| 🦸**Reliable Payer** | Pays on time, contribution close to expected share |
| 🐢 **Slow but Pays** |	Average settlement delay > group average but eventually clears dues |
| 🎭 **Often Delays** |	Frequently crosses reminder thresholds |
| 💸 **Over-Contributor** |	Pays significantly more than expected share |

Example: **"Slow but Pays" Logic**

A user receives this tag when:

Their average payment delay exceeds the room average

But their total dues are eventually cleared

No outstanding balance beyond the defined limit

This helps tailor reminder tone and prevent unnecessary social friction.
